- Data Journalism and Visualization

## Project Experience

I have participated in several projects, including:

- **Intelligent Q&A System**: Clinical Q&A system based on open-source large language models
- **Data Analysis Project**: Analysis and visualization of publicly available heart failure patient datasets

## Hobbies and Interests

Beyond academic research, I love outdoor cycling and exploring urban and natural landscapes. I have completed several long-distance cycling challenges, including cycling around Taihu Lake. If there are fellow cycling enthusiasts, welcome to exchange cycling routes and experiences! I also enjoy reading and traveling, believing that diverse life experiences can bring new inspiration to academic research.
